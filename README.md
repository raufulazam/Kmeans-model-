# Kmeans-model-
In this project i have used various packages like numpy, pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, etc . 
used "elbow" method to find optimal number of cluster for the given datasets . 
 by using that no of cluster i have  trained the kmeans model and predicted the outputs . 
i also check the accuracy_score of the model by using accuracy_score . and finally represented it visually
